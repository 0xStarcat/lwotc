 - Long War does some stuff around Bladestorm and Rapid Fire in X2Ability_RangerAbilitySet. No idea if it's still necessary.

 General notes:
 
  * Enabling the building of weapons is handled in `LWTemplateMods.ReconfigGear()`
  
  
  TODO:
  
   X Migrate perk pack
   X Migrate Officer pack
   X Don't override promotion screen for faction soldiers
   X Fix Officer Training Complete dialog
   X Add secondary weapons (holotargeter, combat knife, sawed-off shotgun, arc thrower)
   X Fix evac!
   X Enable larger squads on missions (can do this with robojumper's Squad Select)
   X Open up utility slots
   X Restore grenade ability/perk icons in tactical HUD
   X Port alien pack
   X Enable LW2 Gatecrasher with 8-man squad (and rainbow pod?)
   ------------------------------------------------------------
   X Switch over to Alien tactical AI
   X Ensure rookies get promotion after 1st mission
   X Buff soldier stats to LW levels and randomize
   X Fix rank names for normal soldiers and officers (requires overriding a
     bunch of classes in the highlander as there is no easy way to inject a
	 different display rank for soldiers)
   X Show all soldiers of a > 6 man squad after a mission (currently just shows first 6 - probably needs Toolbox)
   X Remove AWC from build facilities (it's actually a localization issue for the infirmary)
   X Make sure faction weapons can be upgraded (and armour? Armour gets upgraded with normal soldier armour. Weapons have a schematic)
   ------------------------------------------------------------
   X Allow removal of infinite items from squad loadout (see LWListenerManager and search for 'infinite' - think this requires change in the highlander)
   X Make sure utility slots remain at 3, and don't show an upgrade slot that comes with armour
   * Work out why LWListenerManager is created twice (and fix!)
   * Find out how to enable LW strategy layer - all classes are in place...
   * Disable graze band and camera rotation options in LWToolbox
   * Display combat intelligence, bond, and AP in armory screen for soldier
   * Enable second-wave options like red fog (Just need to test that it works - might be worth adding Yet Another F1 Mod to help)
   * Don't make it so easy to contact new factions
   * Faction soldier reward for contacting a faction doesn't get 3 utility slots (this may have been fixed with other utility slot fixes)
   * Disable sitreps for LW missions?
   * Disable LW strategic objectives for now
   * Fix Technical abilities (animations and burn tiles aren't matching targeting and damage/pawn tiles
     - see https://github.com/shiremct/WOTC_LW2Secondaries/pull/1 for potential fix [UPDATE Doesn't seem to work])
   * Cancelling hack before it completes crashes the game (I'm sure this used to happen in a previous version of LW2)
   * Test abilities: double tap, combat rush, suppression, area suppression, rapid fire, bastion, sedate, full override
   * Add WOTC units to encounter lists
   * Replace ADVENT General with WOTC Field Marshall? I think they share the same template name...
   -- [I think I'll pass on this and go straight to strategy overhaul] Spawn LW missions (see XComGameState_MissionCalendar, X2StrategyElement_DefaultMissionSources and X2StrategyElement_XpackMissionSources)
   * Enable squad management (XComGameState_LWSquadManager)
   * Update Psi handling
   * Enable LW2 strategy layer
   * Allow configuration of graze band (requires override of ToHitCalc_StandardAim - ignore for now)
   * Enable camera rotation (use another mod for this)
   * Add robojumper's squad select (currently crashes start of tactical missions when I integrate it)
