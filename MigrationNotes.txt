 General notes:
 
  * Enabling the building of weapons is handled in `LWTemplateMods.ReconfigGear()`
  
  
  TODO:
  
   * Migrate useful parts of ToolBox (or maybe just all of it)
   X Migrate perk pack
   X Migrate Officer pack
   X Don't override promotion screen for faction soldiers
   X Fix Officer Training Complete dialog
   X Add secondary weapons (holotargeter, combat knife, pump-action shotgun, arc thrower)
   X Fix evac!
   X Enable larger squads on missions (can do this with robojumper's Squad Select)
   X Open up utility slots
   X Restore grenade ability/perk icons in tactical HUD
   * Migrate alien pack
   * Add robojumper's squad select (currently crashes start of tactical missions when I integrate it)
   * Fix rank names for normal soldiers and officers (requires overriding a
     bunch of classes in the highlander as there is no easy way to inject a
	 different display rank for soldiers)
   * Enable squad management (XComGameState_LWSquadManager)
   * Test abilities: double tap, combat rush, suppression, area suppression, rapid fire, bastion, sedate, full override
   * Make sure faction weapons can be upgraded (and armour?)
   * Fix technical abilities (particularly first one!)
   * Switch over to Alien AI
   * Make sure utility slots remain at 3, and don't show an upgrade slot that comes with armour
   * See if it's possible to add extra utility slots to faction soldiers that works
