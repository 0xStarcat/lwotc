 General notes:
 
  * Enabling the building of weapons is handled in `LWTemplateMods.ReconfigGear()`
  
  
  TODO:
  
   X Migrate perk pack
   X Migrate Officer pack
   X Don't override promotion screen for faction soldiers
   X Fix Officer Training Complete dialog
   X Add secondary weapons (holotargeter, combat knife, sawed-off shotgun, arc thrower)
   X Fix evac!
   X Enable larger squads on missions (can do this with robojumper's Squad Select)
   X Open up utility slots
   X Restore grenade ability/perk icons in tactical HUD
   X Port alien pack
   X Enable LW2 Gatecrasher with 8-man squad (and rainbow pod?)
   * Switch over to Alien tactical AI
   * Ensure rookies get promotion after 1st mission
   * Show all soldiers of a > 6 man squad after a mission (currently just shows first 6)
   * Buff soldier stats to LW levels and randomize
   * Port useful parts of ToolBox (like randomisation of soldier stats)
   * Disable sitreps for LW missions
   * Disable LW strategic objectives for now
   * Fix Technical abilities (animations and burn tiles aren't matching targeting and damage/pawn tiles)
   * Cancelling hack before it completes crashes the game (I'm sure this used to happen in a previous version of LW2)
   * Add robojumper's squad select (currently crashes start of tactical missions when I integrate it)
   * Fix rank names for normal soldiers and officers (requires overriding a
     bunch of classes in the highlander as there is no easy way to inject a
	 different display rank for soldiers)
   * Test abilities: double tap, combat rush, suppression, area suppression, rapid fire, bastion, sedate, full override
   * Make sure faction weapons can be upgraded (and armour?)
   * Make sure utility slots remain at 3, and don't show an upgrade slot that comes with armour
   * See if it's possible to add extra utility slots to faction soldiers that works
   * Add WOTC units to encounter lists
   * Enable LW2 strategy layer
   * Enable squad management (XComGameState_LWSquadManager)
