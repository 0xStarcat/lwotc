# Long War of the Chosen

This is an attempt to port the Long War 2 (LW2) overhaul mod for XCOM 2 to the War
of the Chosen (WOTC) expansion. The scope is limited to getting the base LW2 experience
working, but not necessarily balanced. If WOTC features severely unbalance the game and
can be removed, they will be.

## Building and running the mod

The port is not playable as a game, so only the dedicated and experienced should attempt
to install it. Use ModBuddy to load the solution file at the root of the repository.

Building and running the mod has these requirements:

 * X2WOTCCommunityHighlander with the following patches:
  - [Pull request #401](https://github.com/X2CommunityCore/X2WOTCCommunityHighlander/pull/401)
  - [Pull request #411](https://github.com/X2CommunityCore/X2WOTCCommunityHighlander/pull/411)
  - [Pull request #416](https://github.com/X2CommunityCore/X2WOTCCommunityHighlander/pull/416)
 * robojumper's Squad Select for WOTC (you may want to change the default max squad size)

If and when the mod reaches a playable state, I'll publish it and make sure that these
instructions are easier to follow for those that want to play with a development version.
