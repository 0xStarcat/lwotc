Welcome to **dev build 14** of Long War of the Chosen!

This is an experimental build in which many changes are being tested out. It is a drop-in replacement for earlier dev builds and beta 2. 

**Important** You must disable the Revival Protocol Fixes mod with this build! It wasn't fixing the Revival Protocol bugs properly, so we have implemented the fixes directly in LWOTC instead. Once you've disabled the mod, loading an existing campaign will warn about it being missing. That's fine and the warning can be safely ignored.

This is mostly a bug fix release, with the following changes:

* Steady Weapon has been reworked (again):
  * It provides +20 aim, +20 crit chance on all tiers of weapons
  * It is now available on assault rifles, Gunners' cannons, shotguns and SPARK cannons in addition to sniper rifles
  * Soldiers no longer lose the buff if they're wounded by the enemy before they can use it
  * It can no longer be used from concealment
* Beam Shard Gauntlets now get Deep Focus
* Squad Sight is now a tier 2 XCOM ability for Reapers instead of tier 1
* The number of available covert actions (CAs) increases with influence now (low: 4, medium: 5, high: 6)
* The Recruit Extra Faction Soldier CA no longer spawns before you can undertake it (it requires high influence)
* The Intense Training CA can spawn for multiple factions at the same time
* The Intense Training CA can now be started
* Enemy units should no longer be able to target through walls and other obstructions with AoE abilities, like Poison Spit
* Revival Protocol will no longer give extra actions to stunned and disoriented units that are revived
* Templar's Solace is no longer a free action and has a 2-turn cooldown
* Purifiers will now be able to use their flamethrower while disoriented
* No faction soldier XCOM ability should cost 25 AP now
* Lone Wolf can no longer appear as an XCOM ability for Reapers
* HEAT Warheads can no longer appear as a tier 2 XCOM ability for Skirmishers (it's only tier 1 now)

We hope you enjoy the mod, and good luck commanders!
